# U.S. Airline Flight Routes, Fares, and Passenger Volumes (1993-2024) - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive dataset detailing U.S. airline flight routes, fares, and passenger volumes from 1993 to 2024. The dataset includes key metrics such as origin and destination cities, distances between airports, passenger numbers, and fare information by airline carrier. The goal of this analysis is to uncover trends in air travel, pricing, and airline competition over three decades.

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize the distribution of key variables, identify trends, and understand relationships within the data.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Used for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Primary library for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Key Findings

- Analysis revealed significant trends in passenger volumes, fare variations, and the market share of airline carriers.
- Identified key routes with the highest passenger volumes and analyzed fare trends over time.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my ability to perform comprehensive EDA using Pandas, including data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. The insights derived from this analysis can inform decisions related to pricing strategies, route planning, and understanding market dynamics within the U.S. airline industry.
